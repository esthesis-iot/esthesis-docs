A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a
physical object or process. Digital twins are the result of continual improvement in the creation
of product design and engineering activities. The digital twin of a physical object is dependent
on the digital thread — the lowest level design and specification for a digital twin — and the
"twin" is dependent on the digital thread to maintain accuracy. The idea first arose at NASA, where
full-scale mockups of early space capsules used on the ground to mirror and diagnose problems in orbit,
eventually gave way to fully digital simulations.

_esthesis_ provides a rich Digital Twin API, allowing third-party applications to interact, query,
and control the underlying physical devices. The following sections provide an overview on how you
can use the Digital Twin API in your applications.

== Applications
Interaction of a third-party application with the Digital Twin API starts by registering a new
application in _esthesis_:

You can use any alphanumeric value for the security token, or ask _esthesis_ to create a UUID for
you by cliking on the 'Generate Token' button. The token value is what uniquely identifies your
own application to _esthesis_, allowing it to authenticate and have access to the Digital Twin API.

== API
The Digital Twin API is described using OpenAPI specification 3, and the JSON file is available on:
`/api/v3/api-docs`. An HTML representation of the Digital Twin API is also available using Swagger at:
`/api/swagger-ui.html`. You can also find the locations of these two resources in your own installation
under the `About` page:

=== Authentication
Authentication with the Digital Twin API takes place via a bearer HTTP header token. The name of the
header is `Authorization` and its value is the token you have generated when you registered your third-party
app with _esthesis_ under _Applications_ page, prefixed with `Bearer`. This is how a `cURL` call could
look like using the bearer token:
```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:46000/api/dt/devices' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 9c5770b1-6386-dd6d-c89b-9f01c72052c9'
```
All calls to the Digital Twin API should include the `Authorization` header in order to be successfully
authenticated with _esthesis_.

=== Endpoints
For details on each Digital Twin REST endpoint, visit the online manual available at `/api/swagger-ui.html`.
