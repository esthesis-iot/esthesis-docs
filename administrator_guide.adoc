== Quick setup
How many times have you installed a new product, finding yourself having to read a ton of documentation on how to set it up before you can even start using it? Well, _esthesis_ might also have a ton of documentation, however that does not prevent us from showing you how you can quickly set it up to have a working platform in under 10'. Ready?

TIP: Make sure you have a complete installation done first following your preferred method from the link:installation_guide.adoc[Installation guide].
