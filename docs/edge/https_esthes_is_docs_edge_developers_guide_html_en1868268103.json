The names of your endpoints should be prefixed with the name of your module, for example weather/forecast.\nYou can create public and admin endpoints. Public endpoints can be accessed by any user, while admin endpoints require the user to be authenticated using the esthesis EDGE secret token.\nesthesis EDGE provides two annotations that can be useful when creating your module\u0027s endpoints:\n- @ModuleEndpoint(enabledProperty \u003d \u0026quot;esthesis.edge.modules.mymodule.enabled\u0026quot;) The ModuleEndpoint annotation, allows you to enable or disable your module\u0027s endpoints by setting the value of the enabledProperty to true or false in the application.yaml configuration file. This annotation is mandatory, so that users can selectively enable or disable your module. - @AdminEndpoint The AdminEndpoint annotation, allows you to create an endpoint that requires the user to be authenticated using the esthesis EDGE secret token. This annotation is optional, and you can use it only if you need to create an endpoint that requires authentication. Please do not forget to provide complete OpenAPI documentation for your module\u0027s endpoints.
