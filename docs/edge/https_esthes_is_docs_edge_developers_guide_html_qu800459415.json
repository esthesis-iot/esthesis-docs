Those two phases are separated by a queue held in the MariaDB of esthesis EDGE, where the data is stored until it is synchronised.\nThe way in which data is fetched as well as all necessary data structures to support this are totally up to you. To be able to queue your data for esthesis EDGE to synchronise them to esthesis CORE you should use the esthesis Line Protocol (eLP). The specification of eLP can be found in esthesis CORE, and esthesis EDGE provide helper classes to make it easier for you to create eLP representations our of your own data structures via tha QueueService class.\nYou can prepare a new item to be queued using the QueueItem class. QueueService class provides a queue(QueueItemDTO queueItemDTO) method allowing you to persist your data in the queue. eLP comes into play in the dataObject property of the QueueItemDTO class. You can create eLP-compatible dataObject properties using the provided ELPEntry class and its builder, for example:\nELPEntry.builder()\n  .category(\"mycategory\")\n  .date(Instant.now())\n  .measurement(\"12i\")\n  .build()\n  .toString()\nEach dataObject might contain multiple eLP entries separated by a new line character, provided all such entries belong to the same device.\n","pageTitle":"Queuing data","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"","root":0,"depth":0}
