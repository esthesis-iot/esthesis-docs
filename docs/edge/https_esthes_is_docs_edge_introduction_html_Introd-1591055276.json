It acts as a data collector and synchroniser, retrieving information from third-party systems, such as sensors, devices, or other external data sources, at the edge of a network.\nOnce the data is fetched, esthesis EDGE processes and stores it locally, ensuring low-latency responses and high availability, even when the connection to the central system, esthesis CORE, is intermittent. It then synchronises the collected data with esthesis CORE, which serves as the central hub for managing, analysing, and storing aggregated data from multiple edge or standalone/agent-based deployments.\nKey features of esthesis EDGE include:\n2. Data Collection: Fetches data from various third-party systems, such as IoT devices, databases, or external APIs. 4. Edge Deploymentt: Operates close to the data source to minimize latency and ensure reliable operation even with unreliable connectivity. 6. Local Processing: Performs initial processing and filtering of data before synchronizing it with the core system. 8. Synchronization: Ensures that data is consistently synced with esthesis CORE for centralised analysis and long-term storage. 10. Scalability: Supports multiple edge deployments that can operate independently and communicate with the esthesis CORE system. esthesis EDGE is part of the esthesis IoT platform.\n","pageTitle":"Introduction","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"","root":0,"depth":0}
