Depending on how you have installed esthesis EDGE, you must enable the appropriate module and provide its configuration (client secrets, tokens, keys, etc.).\nData is fetched from third-party systems at regular intervals using an internal cron job. Each module has its own cron job expression, so you can specify the frequency of fetching data for each module separately. Once a cron job for a specific module is triggered, the module fetches data from the third-party system and stores it in a queue table in the MariaDB database of esthesis EDGE. Before stored in the queue, remotely-fetched data is transformed to the esthesis Line Protocol (eLP) format.\n","pageTitle":"Fetching data","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Users guide","root":0,"depth":1}
