However, one of esthesis EDGE\u0027s main advantages is that it integrates flawlessly with esthesis CORE. That effectively means that you can set up esthesis EDGE once, \u0026quot;forget\u0026quot; about it, and then manage your data directly in esthesis CORE - where you have many additional options on how to manage your data, where to store it, how to visualise it, etc.\nFor such an integration to take place, esthesis EDGE follows the same \u0026quot;device\u0026quot; concept as esthesis CORE. For every third-party system that is connected to esthesis EDGE, a virtual device is created in esthesis CORE. This device represents the third-party system and all data fetched from it is stored in the device\u0027s data points. In case you create a module that may represent multiple users, you should create a device for each user. It is up to you to ensure that device names (i.e. hardware IDs) are unique for your own module but also for esthesis CORE and EDGE as a whole. A good naming strategy is to prefix hardware IDs with the name of your module, followed by a unique identifier for the user.\n","pageTitle":"Creating devices","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"","root":0,"depth":0}
