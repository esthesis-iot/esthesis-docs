Modules are developed in an incremental fashion, provided a third-party system is of a nature that may be of interest to other users. If you want to integrate a third-party system into esthesis EDGE, please suggest so in our GitHub repository.\nFetching data from a third-party system and then synchronising it is a two-step process as presented next:\n---\ntitle: Fetching, processing, and data synchronisation in esthesis EDGE\n---\nsequenceDiagram\n    esthesis EDGE--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;+Module A: Cron trigger \n    Module A-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;System A: Fetch data\n    System A-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Module A: Return data\n    Module A-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;-esthesis EDGE: Post data\n    esthesis EDGE-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;MariaDB: Queue data\n\n    esthesis EDGE--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;+esthesis EDGE: Cron trigger\n    esthesis EDGE-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;InfluxDB: Synchronise\n    esthesis EDGE-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;-MQTT server: Synchronise\n\n    esthesis CORE--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;+MQTT server: Update\n","pageTitle":"How it works","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Users guide","root":0,"depth":1}
