Both targets are optional, and you can enable or disable them in the configuration of esthesis EDGE.\nThe duration for which data is kept in the local queue depends on two conditions:\n2. Data that has been fully synchronised (i.e. successfully persisted to all targets you have enabled) is removed from the queue based on a configurable retention period. The frequency of how often the retention period is checked is also configurable. This option allows you to keep data in the queue for a certain period, in case you want to re-synchronise it or to keep it for debugging purposes. 4. Data that has not been fully synchronised (i.e. not successfully persisted to all targets you have enabled) is kept in the queue until a configurable time limit is reached. The frequency of how often the time limit is checked is also configurable. This option allows you to clean up the queue from data that for one reason or another could not be synchronised, so that your queue does not grow indefinitely. Make sure that there is enough storage available for the MariaDB database, as the queue can grow quickly if you have enabled many modules with a high frequency of data fetching with high retention periods.
