Modules allow you to add new features, fetching data from any third-party system you can communicate with. However, before creating a new module, you should take into account whether the specific third-party system you want to integrate with is of a generic-enough nature, to be part of esthesis EDGE. For private or very specific third-party systems, it is recommended to integrate them with an esthesis CORE agent running alongside them. At any rate, before you decide to create a new module, you can open a new issue on our GitHub to discuss it first.\n","pageTitle":"Creating new modules","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"","root":0,"depth":0}
