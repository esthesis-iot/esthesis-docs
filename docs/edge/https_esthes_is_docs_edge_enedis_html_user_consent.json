The process starts with the user visiting an application page where information about the application as well as the purpose of the data collection is displayed. If the user agrees, they are redirected to the Enedis login page where they can log in and give their consent. After the user has given their consent, they are redirected back to the application where the consent is stored and the application can start fetching data.\nThe initial \u0026quot;welcome page\u0026quot; can be created by the Enedis module, featuring three custom images, a customised title, and a customised message; it may look similar to this:\nenedis-welcome-page.png Alternatively, you can set up the Enedis module to redirect the user to a custom URL of your choice, where you can display the information and ask for the user\u0027s consent. The URL can be set in the Enedis module configuration.\n","pageTitle":"User consent","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Users guide///Modules","root":0,"depth":2}
