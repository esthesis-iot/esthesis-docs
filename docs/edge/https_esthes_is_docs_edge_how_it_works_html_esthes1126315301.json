This synchronisation takes place by esthesis EDGE emulating esthesis CORE devices, similar to what esthesis CORE device agent provides. Such emulated devices appear as esthesis CORE devices, having a type of \u0026quot;edge\u0026quot;, and can be used in the same way as any other device in esthesis CORE; of course, being emulated devices, they do not provide a pseudo-shell, nor can they reply to commands.\nNote that for esthesis CORE data sync to work, you must have first allowed esthesis EDGE to register its own devices to esthesis CORE. To do so, you must have device registration enabled on esthesis CORE. Once an esthesis EDGE device is registered to esthesis CORE, you can then switch device registration off in esthesis CORE, provided you do not expect any other devices to register to esthesis CORE.\nThe frequency of synchronising data with esthesis CORE is configurable.\n","pageTitle":"esthesis CORE data sync","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Users guide","root":0,"depth":1}
