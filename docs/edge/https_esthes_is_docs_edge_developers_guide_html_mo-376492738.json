However, there are some guidelines you should follow to make sure your module is compatible with esthesis EDGE.\nNew modules should be placed into their own package under esthesis.edge.modules.modulename, for example esthesis.edge.modules.weather. Create a main module entry-class, using a method such as public void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent ev), in order to provide some startup information to the users of esthesis EDGE on your module. A message like \u0026quot;XYZ module is enabled.\u0026quot; is recommended, however you can provide any information you see fit.\n","pageTitle":"Module structure","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"","root":0,"depth":0}
