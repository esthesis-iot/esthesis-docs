They in which registration and tags creation/selection is handled is presented next:\n- Device does not specify any tag When a device is registering without specifying any tag, esthesis CORE will assign a random MQTT server to it. This is to make sure that your device is still registered and can be accessed by esthesis CORE, even if you do not have any tags defined. It is strongly suggested that you always specify a tag when registering your devices. - Device specifies a single tag that is defined in esthesis CORE When a device specifies a single tag that is defined in esthesis CORE, the device will be assigned the MQTT server that is associated with that tag. - Device specifies multiple tags that are all defined in esthesis CORE When a device specifies multiple tags that are all defined in esthesis CORE, the device will be assigned a random MQTT server associated with all defined tag. - Device specifies a single tag that is not defined in esthesis CORE When a device specifies a single tag that is not defined in esthesis CORE, the tag can be automatically created in esthesis CORE, or not, based on the \u0026quot;Device tags\u0026quot; configuration under \u0026quot;Settings\u0026quot;. - If allow new tags to be created during registration, the device will be registered, the provided tag will be created in esthesis CORE, however no MQTT server will be assigned to it. To be able to connect this device to esthesis CORE, you need to manually change the device\u0027s settings to define an MQTT server; this requires you having remote or physical access to the device. - If you do not allow new tags to be created during registration, the device will be registered, no new tag will be created, and a random MQTT server will be assigned to the device. - Device specifies multiple tags that are not defined in esthesis CORE This is similar to the above case, however multiple tags will be created or ignored. - Device specifies multiple tags, some exists in esthesis CORE some they do not - If esthesis CORE is configured to allow new tags to be created during registration, the device will be registered, the provided tags that are not defined in esthesis CORE will be created, and the device will be assigned a random MQTT server out of the tags that already exist. - If esthesis CORE is configured to not allow new tags to be created during registration, the device will be registered, no new tags will be created, and the device will be assigned a random MQTT server out of the tags that already exist. As you can see, tags is a powerful mechanism providing you a lot of flexibility, however not planning your tags carefully may lead to unexpected behavior. It is strongly suggested that you always define your tags before registering your devices, and that you have a well-thought tags strategy.\n","pageTitle":"Device registration","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Startup guide","root":0,"depth":1}
