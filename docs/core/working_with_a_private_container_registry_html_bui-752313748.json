This variable should point to the IP address, port, and user/project name of your private registry, for example:\nESTHESIS_REGISTRY_TYPE\u003dopen ESTHESIS_REGISTRY_URL\u003d192.168.50.211:5000/esthesis ./publish.sh\n192.168.50.211:5000 is used as an example in all following configurations too, change it according to your own setup. Note that since your private registry will be insecure, you need to add it to the insecure registries list. To do so, create a file buildkit.toml and place it in the same level as the publish.sh script. The contents of this file should be similar to:\ninsecure-entitlements \u003d [ \"network.host\", \"security.insecure\"]\n[registry.\"192.168.50.211:5000\"]\n  http \u003d true\n  insecure \u003d true\nIn case you are pushing to a private registry requiring authentication, you can define the following environment variables:\nESTHESIS_REGISTRY_TYPE\u003dauth\nESTHESIS_REGISTRY_USERNAME\u003d\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nESTHESIS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\u003d\u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\n","pageTitle":"Building and pushing images","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
