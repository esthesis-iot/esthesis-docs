Configuring Time Intervals","content":"The DFL allows you to configure a minimum time interval (in seconds) for forwarding data from Kafka to Orion. This prevents data from being sent every time new data arrives and instead sends it periodically.\nFor example: Setting the configuration value to 900 (15 minutes) ensures that the same measurement will only be sent at least once every 15 minutes. Any values received for that measurement during the interval will not be sent to Orion until the interval elapses.\nImportant: To ensure this configuration works reliably, make sure there is only one Kafka message consumer configured for this DFL instance. Multiple consumers could disrupt the interval-based forwarding logic.\nImportantÂ²: This interval rule will not be triggered by past data of a measurement that has already been sent in real time. In other words, for historical data ingestion, any required interval should be prepared beforehand.\n","pageTitle":"2.
