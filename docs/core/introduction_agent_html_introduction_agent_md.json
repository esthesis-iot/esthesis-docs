The device agent is available both as a Docker container supporting multiple architectures, as well as a standalone executable built for different platforms and Operating Systems.\nPlease note that the device agent itself is not capable of connecting to your own sensors, actuators, etc. Its purpose is to provide the necessary communication infrastructure for your devices to connect to esthesis CORE. You must gather your data using your own software and then send it to the device agent. The following figure presents a high-level overview of this process:\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Sensors\n    participant Custom software\n    participant Device Agent\n    participant Message broker\n    participant esthesis Dataflow\n    participant Data persistence\n\t\tSensors--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Custom software: Push data\n\t\tCustom software-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Sensors: Pull data\n\t\tCustom software-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Device Agent: Push data\n\t\tDevice Agent-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Message broker: Publish\n\t\tNote left of Device Agent: MQTT/HTTP\n\t\testhesis Dataflow-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Message broker: Subscribe\n\t\testhesis Dataflow-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Data persistence: Persist data\n","pageTitle":"esthesis device agent","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Device Agent","root":0,"depth":1}
