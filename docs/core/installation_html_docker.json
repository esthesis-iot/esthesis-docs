The esthesis device agent supports a plethora of configuration options (see ), however the minimum configuration required to successfully start it up and have it connect to esthesis CORE is the following:\ndocker run \\\n\t-e HARDWARE_ID\u003dtest-device-1 \\\n\t-e REGISTRATION_URL\u003dhttp://esthesis-core.domain/api/agent/v1/register \\\n\testhesisiot/esthesis-core-device\n2. You must replace the REGISTRATION_URL environment variable with the hostname matching your installation.\n4. You must create/mount a data volume to the container, so that the device agent can persist its state. If you do not do so, the device agent will not be able to reconnect to esthesis CORE after a restart, instead it will create to re-register (and probably fail if you have kept the HARDWARE_ID unchanged).\nDocker images are maintained for the following architectures:\n- linux/arm/v6 - linux/arm/v7 - linux/arm64 - linux/amd64 ","pageTitle":"Docker","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Device Agent","root":0,"depth":1}
