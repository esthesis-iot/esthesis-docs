You need to access the UI via HTTPS, accessing it via HTTP will not work. 4. The UI is exposed under the domain you specified in the environmental variable ESTHESIS_UI_INGRESS_HOSTNAME. 6. If you are using a self-signed certificate which is not imported into your local system, before trying to log in into the application you need to visit the Keycloak URL first and accept the certificate.

If you do not have the necessary permissions to properly configure this Service Account during the installation of the Helm chart, you can disable the automatic creation of the Service Account by setting the ESTHESIS_KUBERNETES_SERVICE_CREATE_RBAC environmental variable to false and create the Service Account manually. The resources that need to be manually created can be found in esthesis-core-srv-kubernetes and need to be available and properly configured before the installation of the Helm chart.
