The table below summarises the resources you can access after running the above command. Replace \u0026lt;namespace\u0026gt; with the namespace you have deployed the services to. Note that if you have deployed the services in a different namespace than esthesis, you need to adjust the namespace element in the domains in the table below: 4. You may need to, occasionally, restart kubefwd, especially if pods get recreated often or if your development machine went through sleep mode. 6. The Container Registry is deployed as a NodePort service with a randomly assigned port. If you need to specify your own port, you can use the REGISTRY_NODE_PORT environment variable when deploying the Helm Chart.
