For example, when a device is deleted from the system, it might be necessary to remove the history of commands that were sent to it.\nIn esthesis CORE, we use a Kafka-based mechanism to notify services of events that occur in other services. To facilitate and standardise the use of this mechanism, we have created a library named util-kafka-notifications. The aim of this library is not only to provide utility code when you want to send and receive notifications, but also to provide a standardised way of doing so.\n","pageTitle":"Inter-service notifications","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
