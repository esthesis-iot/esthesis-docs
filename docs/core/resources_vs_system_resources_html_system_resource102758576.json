Here is an example of how this can be done:\nrest-client:\n\tSettingsSystemResource:\n\t\turl: http://esthesis-core-srv-settings-service:8080\n\t\tscope: Singleton\nThe above snippet defines the URL of the SettingsSystemResource service. You can then inject the SettingsSystemResource REST client into your source service and use it to communicate with the Settings service.\nIn this case, the source service will act as an OIDC client, therefore it needs to be configured appropriately to obtain an access token from the OIDC provider. This is done by adding the following properties to the source service\u0027s application.properties file:\noidc-client:\n\tclient-id: esthesis\n\tgrant:\n\t\ttype: password\n\tgrant-options:\n\t\tpassword:\n\t\t\tusername: ${OIDC_CLIENT_USERNAME}\n\t\t\tpassword: ${OIDC_CLIENT_PASSWORD}\n${OIDC_CLIENT_USERNAME} and ${OIDC_CLIENT_USERNAME} are environment variables allowing the OIDC client to authenticate against the OIDC provider using a password grant. For development, you can set those values to the default values used in esthesis\u0027 default Keycloak esthesis-realm esthesis-system. In production, those values will be provided by the Kubernetes deployment descriptor resulting from the esthesis Helm charts. To instruct Helm to inject those values into a deployment, you need to set the following flags to the deployment.yaml descriptor of the source service:\n\"podOidcClient\" true\n","pageTitle":"System Resource Source service","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
