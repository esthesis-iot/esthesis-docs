The following examples use the Mosquitto MQTT client, which is available for most operating systems.\nmosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t telemetry -m \"cpu temperature\u003d20\"\nmosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t metadata -m \"net ip\u003d\u0027192.168.1.2\u0027\"\nThe above example considers the esthesis device agent being accessible at 127.0.0.1 IP address. This is fine if you execute the `mosquitto_pub` command on the same device as the esthesis device agent. If you execute the `mosquitto_pub` command from a different device, you need to replace the IP address with the IP address of the device where the esthesis device agent is running and configure the esthesis device agent to listen to that IP address via the `ENDPOINT_MQTT_LISTENING_IP` environment variable, or the `endpointMqttListeningIP` command line argument.
