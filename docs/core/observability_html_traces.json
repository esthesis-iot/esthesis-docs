There are no special source code actions required to enable tracing, other than properly configuring traces in application.yamlandapplication-dev.yaml files inside each module. Note that tracing is disabled by default when a module runs in production, and enabled by default when a module runs in development.\nQuarkus exports traces using OTel gRPC. In the default development setup, traces are received by Grafana Loki Distributor at port 4317. The distributor is also listening on port 55681 for OTel HTTP traces (notably, used by APISIX).\nTo store and visualise traces we use Grafana Tempo. In our default development setup it is available at Grafana UI \u0026gt; Explore \u0026gt; Tempo.\n","pageTitle":"Traces","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
