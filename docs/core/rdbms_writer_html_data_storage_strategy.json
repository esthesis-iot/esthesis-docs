You can define the name of the table, as well as the name of the columns used for storing the measurement name as well as the measurement value. Use this strategy when you have a relative small number of different measurements how you want to persist, as each measurement requires two columns. Do note that all columns should already exist on your table and have the appropriate data type, the DFL will not create any columns for you. - Multi strategy: The multi strategy persists all incoming telemetry and metadata values in multiple tables. The name of the table is determined by the category of the measurement, as well as the name of the column holding the value.
