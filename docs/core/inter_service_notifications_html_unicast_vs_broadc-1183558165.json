For example, when a tag is deleted, we want to disassociate this tag from all devices that use it; in that case, only a single instance of the Device service should handle the notification and proceed removing the tag from the devices. On the other hand, when a user is closing a dashboard we want to unsubscribe from receiving events for that dashboard; since multiple instances of the Dashboard service might be running, and we do not know which one is handling the SSE broadcaster for that specific client, we want the notification to be broadcasted to all instances of the Dashboard service - the one that is handling the SSE broadcaster for that client will then unsubscribe the client.\nTo facilitate this, we have implemented a unicast and broadcast mechanism in the util-kafka-notifications library.\n- When sending a notification, you can specify whether the notification should be unicast or broadcast. By default, all notifications are unicast. To send a broadcast notification, you need to set the broadcast attribute of the AppMessage to true (or the equivalent annotation, see below). - When receiving a notification, you just subscribe to the unicast or broadcast topic accordingly (you can have your component subscribing to both topics, if necessary). Remember that for the broadcast topic, you need to provide a random consumer group ID.
