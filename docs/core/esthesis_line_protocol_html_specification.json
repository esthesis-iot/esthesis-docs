The timestamp value is shared between all measurements of the same line. If you need to send multiple measurements with each one having a unique timestamp, split them in different lines and specify a separate timestamp for each. If a timestamp value is not present, the time at the time of processing the message will be used as a timestamp.\n","pageTitle":"Specification","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"References","root":0,"depth":1}
