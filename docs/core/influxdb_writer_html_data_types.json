When new incoming data is encountered and a measurement is created in InfluxDB, this measurement is initiated in InfluxDB with a specific data type. InfluxDB will try to automatically determine the data type of the field, however this might not always be what you want. For example, consider the case of your sensor values being decimal numbers. If for any reason your devices send non-decimal values of your sensors without a decimal part (i.e. \u0026quot;.0\u0026quot;), then InfluxDB might consider this field to be an integer type instead of a float type. This can lead to issues when you later on try to persist decimal values, as InfluxDB will reject these values.\nTo avoid such issues, the esthesis Line Protocol (eLP) allows you to specify the data type of a value by providing hints as suffixes. When possible, we strongly recommend to use this mechanism to avoid surprises. When a data type is explicitly specified in eLP, this DFL will explicitly create the requested type in InfluxDB thus guaranteeing your future values will be properly processed.\n","pageTitle":"Data types","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Dataflows","root":0,"depth":1}
