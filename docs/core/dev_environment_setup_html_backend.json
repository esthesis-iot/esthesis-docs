You need to run each of the services in a separate terminal window.\nMany of the backend services need to access the dependency services (e.g. Keycloak, Kafka, MongoDB, etc.) you have deployed above. To be able to figure out the domain name under which these services are accessible, we are using internally kubens -c, so make sure before you start up a service you have switched to the Kubernetes context and namespace where the services are deployed.\n","pageTitle":"Backend","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
