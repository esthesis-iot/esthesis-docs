It is important to note that the value of the configKey parameter must match the name of the service in source service\u0027s application.properties file. - Annotate the SettingsSystemResource interface with @RegisterProvider(OidcClientRequestReactiveFilter.class). This annotation tells Quarkus to inject the OidcClientRequestReactiveFilter into the REST client, which is responsible to obtain (e.g. create) a valid access token from the OIDC provider and propagate it to the target service. Using this annotation the source service acts as an OIDC client obtaining a new access token for itself which then uses to identifies itself to the target service. In esthesis\u0027 default Keycloak esthesis-realm, there is a user created especially for this purpose.
