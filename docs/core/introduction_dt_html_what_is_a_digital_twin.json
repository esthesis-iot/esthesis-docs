Digital Twins are used to optimise operations, predict outcomes, and improve performance by providing insights that are not possible with physical models alone. They are widely used in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities, to enhance efficiency and innovation.\n","pageTitle":"What is a Digital Twin","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Digital Twins","root":0,"depth":1}
