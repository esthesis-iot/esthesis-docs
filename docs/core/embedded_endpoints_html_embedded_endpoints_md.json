Both endpoints are off by default, so you need to enable them before you can use them. The purpose of the embedded endpoints is to allow external sources to forward data to the esthesis platform. Since the endpoints are defined and configured on the esthesis device agent, external sources can forward data to the esthesis platform without having to be aware of any connectivity details, other than the IP address and port of the endpoints on the esthesis device agent.\ngraph LR\n\t\tA[External source]\n\t\tsubgraph device\n\t\t\tB[esthesis device agent]\n\t\tend\n\t\tC[esthesis platform]\n\n\t\tA --\u0026gt;|MQTT / IP:port| B\n\t\tA --\u0026gt;|REST / IP:port| B\n\t\tB --\u0026gt; |MQTT| C\ngraph LR\n\tsubgraph device\n\t\tA[External source] --\u0026gt;|MQTT / 127.0.0.1:1883| B[esthesis device agent]\n\t\tA --\u0026gt;|REST / 127.0.0.1:8080| B\n\tend\n\t\tB --\u0026gt;|MQTT| C[esthesis platform]\nAs depicted above, in the case where the external source is running on the same device as the esthesis device agent, the external source can be configured to use 127.0.0.1.\nBy default, the embedded endpoints do not support security, i.e. they do not support authentication. If you make your endpoints accessible to other devices in your network, make sure you do so in a controlled environment. Alternatively, if your external source is running on the same device as the esthesis device agent, you can have the embedded endpoints only listen to `127.0.0.1` (which is the default value). You can enable authentication for both the HTTP and the MQTT endpoints.\nBoth embedded endpoints expect data to follow the , however you can push any other format you may have and convert it into the esthesis Line Protocol using the functionality of the agent.\n","pageTitle":"Embedded endpoints","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Device Agent","root":0,"depth":1}
