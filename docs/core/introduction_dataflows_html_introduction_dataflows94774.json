It is a way to define a sequence of operations that will be executed on the data before they are acquired, during the acquisition, and finally during persistence.\ndfl-1.png The logical phases in which DFLs operate are:\n- DATA ACQUISITION: During this phase remotely-collected data is first entered into esthesis CORE. The data sender component can be the esthesis CORE agent installed on a remote device, or any other device following the esthesis CORE ELP protocol. esthesis CORE provides a data acquisition DFL based on MQTT, which can acquire data from an MQTT server. - DATA PROCESSING: During this phase data already entered into esthesis CORE is further processed, analysed, etc. esthesis CORE provides data processing DFLs to handle the ping/keep-alive responses of remote devices, to update replies to previously sent commands, to update a REDSI cache, etc. - DATA PERSISTENCE: During this phase, processed data is stored in a persistence storage. esthesis CORE provides data persistence DFLs for InfluxDB, a relational database, FIWARE Orion, etc. ","pageTitle":"Dataflows","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Dataflows","root":0,"depth":1}
