This model is then updated with real-time data to reflect the current state of the object or system. By using simulation, machine learning, and reasoning, Digital Twins can predict future outcomes, identify potential issues, and recommend actions to improve performance.\n","pageTitle":"How do Digital Twins work","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Digital Twins","root":0,"depth":1}
