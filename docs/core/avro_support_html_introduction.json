It provides a compact, fast, and schema-based format for data exchange between different components of distributed systems. Avro focuses on efficient data storage and transmission, making it suitable for use cases where performance and interoperability are critical.\nAt its core, Avro uses a schema to define the structure of the data. The schema describes the fields, their types, and the relationships between them. Avro schemas are defined using JSON, which makes them easy to read, write, and interpret by different programming languages.\nAvro data is serialized in a binary format, which results in compact data representation and efficient storage. This binary format enables fast serialization and deserialization, making Avro suitable for high-performance applications and systems with stringent latency requirements.\n","pageTitle":"Introduction","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"References","root":0,"depth":1}
