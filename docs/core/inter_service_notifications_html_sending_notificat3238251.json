The annotation should be used as a method-level annotation, and it will automatically publish a notification message to Kafka in case your method is executed successfully. The annotation is processed by KafkaNotificationInterceptor.\nThe annotation has the following attributes:\n2. component: The component that is sending the notification. 4. subject: The subject of the notification. 6. action: The action that triggered the notification. 8. comment: A comment that can be used to provide more information about the notification. 10. idParamOrder: The order of the parameter that contains the ID of the object for the notification. This parameter starts at 0 to indicate the first parameter of the method. Make sure that if your method\u0027s parameter order changes, you update this attribute accordingly. 12. idParamRegEx: A regular expression that is used to extract the ID of the object for the notification. If used, this attribute takes precedence over idParamOrder. This parameter is useful in cases where the only argument to a method is a complex object that contains the ID of the object for the notification. See how it is used in register method in DeviceRegistrationService.java as an example.
