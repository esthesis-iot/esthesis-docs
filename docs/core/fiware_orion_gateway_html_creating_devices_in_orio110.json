The DFL can create the device in Orion automatically when configured so. Each device is registered with a name after its hardware ID, however you can set up a device attribute to act as the Orion device name. Similarly, a default device type named \u0027Device\u0027 is used, and that can also be customised in the settings of the DFL.\nYou can have the DFL automatically trying to register in Orion all new devices in esthesis, or specify manually which devices should be registered using a boolean attribute set for devices.\n","pageTitle":"Creating devices in Orion","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Dataflows","root":0,"depth":1}
