It acts as a centralised data repository and processing engine, providing a unified view of the data collected from various edge deployments.\nesthesis CORE provides a flexible data management architecture, using pluggable modules around a Kafka message broker. This architecture allows for easy integration with third-party systems, and we already provide several modules to support common use cases, such as time-series databases, relational databases, redis, and more.\nKey features of esthesis EDGE include:\n2. Dashboards: Rich, real-time dashboard functionality with more than 15 widgets to visualise data. 4. Device management: Remote devices registration, configuration, and management. 6. Command and Control: Remotely control devices by send commands, and receiving responses. 8. Provisioning: Manual or automated device firmware provisioning and onboarding. 10. Campaigns: Schedule and manage tasks to push configurations or firmware updates to devices, using sophisticated workflows, conditions, triggers, and reporting. 12. Certificates, CAs, and Keystores: Manage device certificates, create custom certificate authorities, and export keystores. 14. Data pipelines: Fully customisable data processing pipelines with ready-made modules, or easily integrate your own. 16. Infrastructure management: Register supporting infrastructure, such as an MQTT server, and intelligently assign devices to the best available infrastructure. 18. Digital Twins: Create digital twin applications of devices, and monitor and control the devices in real-time via an intuitive REST API. 20. Tagging: Organise devices into groups using tags, and apply configurations, firmware updates, or send commands based on tags. 22. Security: Manage your users, roles, and permissions, using a flexible and granular permission model. 24. Auditing: Track all user actions, and monitor the system for security and compliance.
