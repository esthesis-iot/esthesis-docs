That effectively means that you need to carefully place security checks and annotations in appropriate places in the code. As a rule of thumb you can go by the following guidelines:\n2. If you are working with the implementation of the client of a service, e.g. TagResourceImpl, annotate all endpoints with @RolesAllowed. This will ensure that the endpoint is secured by OIDC and that only users with the required roles can access it. 4. If you are working with the implementation of the service itself, e.g. TagService, annotate all methods that need to be secured with @ErnPermission. This will ensure that the method is secured by the permission system and that only users with the required permissions can access it.
