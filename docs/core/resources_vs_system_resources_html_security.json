An end-user trying to access an esthesis service needs to provide a valid access token. This token is then validated by the service against the OIDC provider. The same applies to service-to-service communication: The source service needs to provide a valid access token to the target service. This token is then validated by the target service against the OIDC provider.\nBut what happens when a service needs to access another service without having an end-user initiating the request thus providing an access token? This is where the concept of System Resources comes into play.\nEffectively, the differentiation of Resources and System Resources is only relevant to the underlying security mechanism: Resources are services requiring an active end-user (i.e. a valid access token provided by the user), whereas System Resources are services that do not require an active end-user. At this point you may be wondering: \u0026quot;...and who provides the access token for System Resources?\u0026quot;. The following sections provide an overview of how Resources and System Resources are defined and used in esthesis.\n","pageTitle":"Security","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
