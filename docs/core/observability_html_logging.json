All modules export Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) messages that can be captured by a GELF receiver. In the default development setup, GELF messages are received by Grafana Promtail running on the development machine, which then forwards them to a Grafana Loki Distributor running on Kubernetes. When you test a production-like installation, there is a Promtail running inside Kubernetes.\nUnfortunately, we can not provide a Promtail running in Kubernetes for development as Quarkus Logging Gelf component only supports forwarding logs using UDP. UDP port-forwarding is not (yet) supported in Kubernetes, and alternative setups to expose a UDP port are too complex for a development setup. Therefore, for your development setup you run something like the following:\ngraph LR\nsubgraph Development machine\n\tA[Promtail]\n\tB[esthesis service]\n\tE[esthesis service]\n\tF[esthesis service]\nend\nB --\u0026gt;|GELF| A\nE --\u0026gt;|GELF| A\nF --\u0026gt;|GELF| A\nA --\u0026gt;|HTTP| C\n\nsubgraph Kubernetes\n\tC[Loki Distributor]\n\tD[Loki]\nend\nC --\u0026gt; D\nYou can find how to run Promtail locally in the Dev Environment setup page.\n","pageTitle":"Logging","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
