Similarly to when building the services, you should configure your Kubernetes distribution to be able to pull from that insecure registry. The exact way this is done depends on the Kubernetes distribution you are using.\n- K3S: Edit or create /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml and add the following lines:\n\tmirrors:\n\"192.168.50.211:5000\":\nendpoint:\n  - \"http://192.168.50.211:5000\"\nRestart the K3S service with sudo systemctl restart k3s.service.\nDepending on your Kubernetes distribution, you might be able to get away with adding the registry to the insecure registries list by replacing the IP address of your registry with localhost, for example localhost:32000/esthesis.\n","pageTitle":"Deploying Dataflows","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
