However, when you want to test your changes in a production-like Kubernetes environment you need to push your images to a container registry, so that your production-like Kubernetes cluster can pull them from. Considering esthesis CORE maintains many services with support of multiple architectures, pushing all those images to e.g. Docker Hub can take a long time.\nTo speed up the process you can use the private Container Registry provided by esthesis dependencies Helm Chart. The chart will deploy a private registry in your Kubernetes cluster as a NodePort Service. The service will be assigned a random port, so you should take note of the IP of your worker node as well as the assigned port. You can then use the publish.sh script to build and push your images to the private registry.\n","pageTitle":"Working with a private Container Registry","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Developers Guide","root":0,"depth":1}
