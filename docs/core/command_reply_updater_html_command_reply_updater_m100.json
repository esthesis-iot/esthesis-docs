The device then obtains the message from the MQTT server, processes it, and sends a reply to the command reply topic. The Command Reply updater DFL is then picking up command-reply MQTT messages and updates the command reply document collection in the esthesis CORE database.\nThis DFL is largely an internal component of esthesis CORE, necessary to be deployed to ensure that the command reply document collection is updated with the latest information. However, if it suits your use cases, you may deploy additional instances of the FDL, so that you also update replies in a separate database you maintain.\n","pageTitle":"Command Reply Updater DFL","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Dataflows","root":0,"depth":1}
