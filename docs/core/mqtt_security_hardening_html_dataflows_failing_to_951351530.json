In addition, you need to update the dataflow to use a certificate to identify itself to the MQTT broker. Be careful which certificate you will use. Dataflows accessing the MQTT broker, usually, require full-access, that means to be able to subscribe and publish to/from any topic. If you have used the provided Mosquitto configuration, you need to use the certificate of the \u0026quot;superuser\u0026quot; you created while hardening the security of the MQTT broker.\n","pageTitle":"Dataflows failing to connect","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Startup guide","root":0,"depth":1}
