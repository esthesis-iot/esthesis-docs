_esthesis_ is a versatile platform allowing your IoT devices to submit data in a variety of ways. In the most simple form, your devices can submit data by just posting MQTT messages to an MQTT server which is registered with _esthesis_ platform. However, such a setup does not allow you to perform secure operations, ACLs, remote device management, etc. For all these additional services you need the _esthesis_ client runtime.

The runtime client is an application embedded into your IoT device allowing it to communicate with the _esthesis_ platform.
